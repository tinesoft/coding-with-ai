<!--
SYNC IMPACT REPORT:
Version Change: 1.7.2 ‚Üí 1.8.0
Modified Principles: VIII. Sequential Numbering and Consistency Standards - Complete rewrite to enforce module-scoped numbering
Added Sections: Module-Level Numbering, Lab-Level Numbering (within module scope), Exercise-Level Numbering clarifications
Removed Sections: None (replaced global sequential numbering guidance with module-scoped approach)
Templates Requiring Updates:
  ‚úÖ .specify/memory/constitution.md - Updated with module-scoped numbering principle
  ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL existing lab folders require renumbering to follow module-scoped pattern
  ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL lab instruction and solution README files require exercise numbering updates
  ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL exercise slides require lab reference updates
  ‚ö†Ô∏è spec-template.md may require updates to reflect module-scoped lab planning
  ‚ö†Ô∏è tasks-template.md may require updates to reflect module-scoped task organization
Follow-up TODOs:
  1) Rename existing lab folders to follow module-scoped pattern (e.g., lab-01-prompt-basics ‚Üí lab-11-prompt-basics for Module 1)
  2) Update all lab README files to use module-scoped exercise numbering
  3) Update all exercise slides to reference correct module-scoped lab numbers
  4) Update spec files for all modules to reflect module-scoped lab planning
  5) Verify all cross-references between slides, labs, and assessments maintain consistency
Notes: Changed from global sequential lab numbering (lab-01, lab-02, lab-03 across all modules) to module-scoped numbering (Module 1: lab-11, lab-12; Module 2: lab-21, lab-22; etc.). This MAJOR principle change ensures labs are clearly associated with their parent module and numbering resets for each module. Lab folders now use pattern lab-[MODULE_NUMBER][SEQUENCE]-{topic} where MODULE_NUMBER is the module digit (1-7) and SEQUENCE is the sequential position within that module (1, 2, 3...). Exercise numbering within each lab still starts from 1 and increments sequentially.

# SFEIR School Coding with AI Constitution

**Version**: 1.8.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-18 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-09

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Comprehensive 7-day training program targeting beginner to intermediate developers with focus on practical AI coding skills and autonomous agents. Emphasis on hands-on learning with real-world applications and professional development workflow enhancement. All content MUST provide measurable skill building and confidence development for modern AI-enhanced software development.

### II. Content Organization Standards
Place training modules in `docs/markdown/` using SFEIR School Theme markdown syntax (reference: https://github.com/sfeir-open-source/sfeir-school-theme). Structured module progression with clear learning outcomes and sequential numbering system for modules and slides. 

**Slide Class Organization**: Only the main presentation introduction (`00_intro.md`) SHALL use the `class="first-slide"` directive. All module introduction slides MUST use `class="transition"` to maintain consistent navigation flow. Regular content slides use standard slide classes without special designation.

**Content Generation Restrictions**: When generating exercise slides, focus ONLY on the actual exercise content without creating introductory or closing slides. When generating module slides, focus ONLY on the core content without creating introductory or closing transition slides. This ensures lean, focused educational content without unnecessary navigational overhead.

**Exercise Slide Formatting**: Exercise slides MUST use the `class="exercice"` directive and follow this exact heading hierarchy:
```markdown
<!-- .slide: class="exercice" --> 
# Exercice X: {short text}
## Lab XX

<br>

### üëâüèæ Follow **instructions** in

### `labs/lab-XX-{topic}/README.md`

Notes:
- Follow the instructions in the lab README.md for detailed steps.

##--##

<!-- .slide: class="exercice" --> 
# Exercice X: {short text}
## Lab XX

<br>

### üí° Read **solution** at

### `labs/lab-XX-{topic}-solution/README.md`

Notes:
- Read the lab README.md for example of solutions.
```
Where X is the exercise number and XX is the two-digit lab number. Exercise slides SHALL only use H1, H2, or H3 level headers: H1 (#) is reserved for the exercise title, H2 (##) is reserved for the lab generic sub-header ("Lab XX"), and H3 (###) is reserved for specific steps of the exercise. Bold text MAY be used to highlight sections within the exercise content.
```

Where X is the exercise number and XX is the two-digit lab number. Exercise slides SHALL only use H1, H2, or H3 level headers: H1 (#) is reserved for the exercise title, H2 (##) is reserved for the lab generic sub-header ("Lab XX"), and H3 (###) is reserved for specific steps of the exercise. Bold text MAY be used to highlight sections within the exercise content.

**Regular Slide Formatting**: Regular content slides MUST include a `<br>` tag between H2-level (##) and H3-level (###) headers to prevent content overlap. This formatting requirement applies to all standard slides that are not exercise or transition slides:
```markdown
<!-- .slide: -->
# **Slide Title**

## **H2 Section Header**
<br>

### **H3 Subsection Header**
Content here...
```

### III. Lab Structure Requirements
Create sequential lab folders using pattern `labs/lab-XX-{topic}/` with corresponding solution folders `labs/lab-XX-{topic}-solution/`. Each solution folder MUST contain a mandatory `README.md` file and MAY include an optional `resources/` directory for lab outputs and deliverables (e.g., final projects, code samples, generated artifacts). Write all lab instructions in GitHub-flavored markdown format with clear objectives, prerequisites, and success criteria. Provide hands-on exercises with scaffolded projects that demonstrate practical application of module concepts.

**Lab-Slide Content Alignment**: Lab exercises MUST align with and reinforce the learning objectives and content presented in their corresponding module slides. Each lab SHALL provide hands-on practice for concepts introduced in the theoretical slide content. Exercise instructions MUST reference specific techniques, tools, or methodologies covered in the module slides. Learning progression in labs SHALL follow the sequence established in slide presentations to ensure educational coherence and effective skill building.

**Assessment Content Alignment**: Assessment materials including knowledge checks, quizzes, and evaluation criteria MUST accurately reflect the actual content that learners experienced in labs and slide presentations. Assessment questions SHALL be updated when lab content changes to maintain alignment between what is taught and what is tested. This ensures valid measurement of learning outcomes and prevents assessment-instruction misalignment.

**Exercise-Solution Correspondence**: The `lab-XX-{topic}/README.md` file MUST contain all exercises to be completed. The corresponding `lab-XX-{topic}-solution/README.md` file MUST contain the complete solution to each exercise in the same sequential order. Each exercise solution SHALL be clearly marked and correspond exactly to the exercise statement in the main lab file.

**Exercise Numbering Consistency**: When content is removed or reorganized, exercise numbering MUST be updated consistently across all related materials including lab instructions, solutions, exercise slides, and assessment content. Sequential numbering SHALL be maintained without gaps to ensure educational flow and prevent learner confusion.

**Deliverable Organization**: When an exercise solution includes deliverable artifacts (complete projects, code repositories, generated files), the solution text MUST indicate the specific location of these deliverables within the `lab-XX-{topic}-solution/resources/exercise-{X}-complete-project/` subdirectory structure, where X corresponds to the exercise number. Deliverable subdirectories SHALL only be created when required by the exercise's deliverable requirements.

### IV. Asset Management Protocol
Store all visual assets in `docs/assets/images/` using descriptive file names and organized subdirectories by module. Reference assets using relative paths from `docs/` directory in all markdown files. Include slides, diagrams, code screenshots, and supporting visuals while maintaining consistent SFEIR branding standards.

**Visual Format Preference**: When generating or creating visual assets to illustrate concepts in slides, prefer SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format whenever technically feasible. SVG format provides resolution-independent scaling, smaller file sizes for diagrams, easier maintenance through text-based editing, and consistent rendering across all devices and screen resolutions. Raster formats (PNG, JPG, WebP) SHALL only be used when SVG is not technically feasible, such as for photographs, complex photo-realistic images, or graphics with intricate gradients that would result in excessive SVG complexity. For diagrams, flowcharts, architecture illustrations, icons, and technical schematics, SVG MUST be the default choice.

**Visual Presentation Standards**: Illustrative visuals MUST be presented on a dedicated separate slide immediately following the concept slide they illustrate. The visual slide SHALL be created using the slide separator `##--##` after the Notes section of the original concept slide. Visual slides MUST display images at full width while preserving aspect ratio using this exact format:

```markdown
##--##

<img src="{path/to/visual}" alt="{veryShortDescription}" style="width:100%; height:auto; display:block;">
```

When the original concept slide includes a Notes section, that Notes section MUST be updated to reference the visual that follows on the next slide. This ensures clear educational flow where concepts are introduced on one slide and reinforced visually on the dedicated subsequent slide. Visual slides SHALL NOT include additional text, headers, or content beyond the image itself to maintain focus on the illustration.

### V. Quality Assurance Standards
Validate all content against defined educational objectives with focus on practical utility and learner confidence building. Maintain professional code quality standards in all examples and exercises. Prioritize clarity, real-world application, and progressive skill development across all training materials.

**Constitution Compliance Verification**: When making changes to training materials, ALL affected files MUST be systematically reviewed for constitutional compliance. This includes exercise slides, lab instructions, solutions, assessment content, and any cross-references. Changes to one component require verification of consistency across the entire educational package to prevent maintenance burden and ensure cohesive learning experience.

**Content Duplication Prevention**: Exercise slides SHALL NOT duplicate detailed content from lab README files. Slides MUST follow the prescribed format pointing to lab instructions and solutions. This eliminates maintenance overhead and ensures single-source-of-truth for educational content while maintaining proper educational flow.

### VI. Content Accuracy and Currency Requirements
All training materials (slides, labs, exercises, and visual aids) MUST reflect accurate and current information about AI technologies, tools, and best practices as of the constitution's last amendment date. When generating or updating content, verify that all technical information, tool capabilities, API references, and industry practices are current and factually correct. Outdated information MUST be updated or clearly marked with deprecation notices. Content creators SHALL validate all AI tool references, feature availability, and technical specifications against official documentation and current releases before publication.

### VII. Data Sourcing and Citation Requirements
When including metrics, statistics, performance data, or quantitative claims in training materials (slides, labs, exercises), ALL such information MUST be accompanied by a direct link to the original source where that data was obtained. Unsourced data claims SHALL NOT be included in any educational materials. The citation format MUST follow this pattern: `[metric value]([source-link])` to provide immediate access to verification. For example: "**Time to First Working Code**: [30-50% reduction](https://example.com/source)" rather than unsourced claims. This requirement ensures educational integrity, allows learners to verify information independently, and maintains professional standards for factual content. When no verifiable source can be provided, the information MUST be excluded from the training materials entirely.

### VIII. Sequential Numbering and Consistency Standards
All training content MUST maintain strict sequential numbering without gaps to ensure clear educational progression and prevent learner confusion. Sequential numbering SHALL be enforced at three hierarchical levels with MODULE-SCOPED NUMBERING for labs and exercises:

**Module-Level Numbering**: Training modules MUST use sequential numbering (Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, etc.) with no gaps in the sequence. When modules are added, removed, or reorganized, ALL subsequent module numbering MUST be updated to maintain sequential integrity.

**Lab-Level Numbering (Module-Scoped)**: Within each module, laboratories MUST use module-scoped numbering that clearly identifies both the parent module and the sequential position within that module. Lab folder names MUST follow the pattern `lab-[MODULE_NUMBER][SEQUENCE]-{topic}/` where:
- `MODULE_NUMBER` is a single digit (1-7) identifying the parent module
- `SEQUENCE` is a single digit (1, 2, 3...) identifying the sequential position within that module
- Lab numbering RESETS to 1 for each new module
- Examples: Module 1 labs are `lab-11-{topic}`, `lab-12-{topic}`, `lab-13-{topic}`; Module 2 labs are `lab-21-{topic}`, `lab-22-{topic}`, etc.
- This ensures labs are CLEARLY ASSOCIATED with their parent module and prevents ambiguity about which module a lab belongs to.

**Exercise-Level Numbering (Lab-Scoped)**: Within each lab, exercises MUST use sequential numbering (Exercise 1, Exercise 2, Exercise 3, etc.) starting from 1 for the first exercise in each lab. Exercise numbering RESETS to 1 for each new lab. Exercise slides MUST reference labs using the module-scoped format "Lab [MODULE_NUMBER][SEQUENCE]" matching the lab folder name pattern.

**Cross-Reference Consistency**: When content is modified, ALL related materials MUST be updated simultaneously including lab instructions, solutions, exercise slides, assessment content, and navigation references. No orphaned references or broken sequential chains SHALL be permitted. Changes to numbering in one component require immediate verification and update of all dependent references to maintain educational coherence. The module-scoped numbering system ensures clear module boundaries and prevents confusion when working across multiple modules simultaneously.
