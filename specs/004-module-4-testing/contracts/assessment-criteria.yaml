prohibited_content:
  assessment_slides:
    - "Module Recap slides (duplicates Learning Objectives Review)"
    - "Assessment Overview slides (evaluation frameworks belong in specs)"
    - "Assessment Methods slides (evaluation procedures belong in specs)"
    - "Success Metrics slides (target scores/tables belong in specs)"
    - "Assessment Rubric slides (scoring criteria belong in specs)"
    - "Next Steps slides (forward-looking content belongs in trainer materials)"
    - "Thank You slides (ceremonial content belongs in trainer facilitation)"
    
  rationale: "Assessment slides focus on three essential functions: reviewing what was learned (Learning Objectives Review), validating understanding (Knowledge Check), and providing continued learning resources (Resources). Administrative evaluation frameworks, forward-looking navigation, and ceremonial concluding slides belong in specification documents and trainer materials, not learner-facing presentations."

constitutional_compliance:
  - principle: "Assessment Slide Structure"
    requirement: "EXACTLY 4 slides (transition, learning objectives review, knowledge checks across multiple slides, resources)"
    validation: "Count slides in 48_assessment_and_recap.md"
    
  - principle: "Knowledge Check Slide Format"
    requirement: "Each question with inline <details> answer (no separate answer slides)"
    validation: "Verify <details> tags present for all questions"
    
  - principle: "Resources Slide Format"
    requirement: "Bold headers, documentation links with descriptions, module-scoped lab paths"
    validation: "Check formatting matches template exactly"
    
  - principle: "Prohibited Content"
    requirement: "No administrative slides (Assessment Overview, Success Metrics, Rubrics, Next Steps, Thank You)"
    validation: "Ensure only 4 required slide types present"

validation_checklist:
  structure:
    - "Assessment file contains EXACTLY 4 slide types (transition, review, knowledge checks, resources)"
    - "Each knowledge check question on separate slide"
    - "6 total knowledge check question slides (covering all topics)"
    - "Resources slide includes all 3 lab solution references"
    
  formatting:
    - "All knowledge check questions use <details> for inline answers"
    - "Bold formatting applied correctly (H1, H2, H3, option labels)"
    - "<br> spacing tags present where required"
    - "Lab paths use module-scoped numbering (lab-41, lab-42, lab-43)"
    
  content:
    - "Question distribution covers all module topics (2 unit testing, 2 TDD, 1 integration/E2E, 1 quality)"
    - "Documentation links include Vitest, Playwright, GitHub Copilot, testing best practices"
    - "All answers include explanations (not just correct letter)"
    - "Notes sections provide educational context"
    
  prohibited:
    - "No 'Module Recap' slides"
    - "No 'Assessment Overview' slides"
    - "No 'Success Metrics' slides"
