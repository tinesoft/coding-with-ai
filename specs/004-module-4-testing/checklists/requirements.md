# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 4 - Test Automation and Quality Assurance with AI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on learning outcomes, not specific technologies (mentions GitHub Copilot as example tool but principles apply broadly)
- ✅ Written for educational stakeholders (trainers, learners) describing what learners will achieve
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and comprehensive
- ✅ No code samples or implementation details in specification

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements are testable (can verify by checking if slides/labs exist, if learners complete exercises, if content follows standards)
- ✅ 8 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (80%+ coverage, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 75%+ score, 90% completion, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on learner outcomes and educational metrics, not implementation (no mention of specific testing frameworks or tech stack)
- ✅ 4 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified covering common AI testing pitfalls
- ✅ Scope clearly defines what's included (4 lab topics, slides, assessments) and excluded (specialized testing, CI/CD, enterprise architectures)
- ✅ 7 assumptions documented (learner prerequisites, tools available, language choices)
- ✅ 7 dependencies identified (previous modules, frameworks, constitutional guidelines)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to verifiable deliverable (slides, labs, assessments, solutions)
- ✅ User scenarios cover complete learning journey from basic unit testing (P1) to advanced quality assurance (P4)
- ✅ All success criteria are achievable within 1-day module timeframe and measurable through lab completion and assessments
- ✅ No technology stack details in spec - all language/framework references are in Assumptions section as reasonable defaults

## Conclusion

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification meets all quality criteria and is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase. No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete and testable. The spec successfully balances educational goals with measurable outcomes while maintaining technology-agnostic focus appropriate for training content specification.
