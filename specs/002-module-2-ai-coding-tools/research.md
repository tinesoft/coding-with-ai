# Research: Module 2 - Modern AI Coding Tools

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Feature**: Module 2 - Modern AI Coding Tools  
**Status**: Phase 0 Complete

## Research Tasks Completed

### Performance Goals Resolution

**Decision**: Slide load time <2 seconds, lab completion 20-45 minutes per lab  
**Rationale**: Based on SFEIR School Theme capabilities and educational best practices for adult learning attention spans  
**Alternatives considered**: Fixed timing vs. adaptive pacing - chose adaptive with suggested durations

### Current AI Tools Landscape (as of October 2025)

**Decision**: Comprehensive categorization with emphasis on actively maintained tools  
**Rationale**: Rapidly evolving AI tools ecosystem requires current, accurate information per Constitution IX  
**Research findings**:

#### CLI-Based Agents
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: Active, integrated with GitHub ecosystem
- **Aider**: Open-source, actively maintained, supports multiple models
- **Gemini CLI**: Google's offering, good for API integration tasks
- **Warp**: Terminal with AI features, popular among developers
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI tool for code tasks

#### Standalone IDEs  
- **Cursor**: Fork of VS Code with native AI integration, very popular
- **Windsurf**: New entrant with collaborative AI features
- **Zed**: High-performance editor with AI assistant integration
- **Kiro**: Emerging AI-first development environment

#### IDE Extensions
- **GitHub Copilot**: Market leader, three modes (Ask, Edit, Agent)
- **Continue**: Open-source, supports multiple models
- **Cline (formerly Claude Dev)**: Popular Claude integration
- **Amazon Q Developer**: AWS ecosystem integration
- **Roo Code**, **Kilo Code**: Emerging extensions

#### Online Tools (Mention-only)
- **Bolt.new**: Stackblitz's AI web development platform
- **v0 by Vercel**: Component generation tool
- **Replit AI**: Integrated in Replit environment
- **Lovable**: AI-powered app development platform

### GitHub Copilot Custom Agent Research

**Decision**: Use "GPT 4.1 - Beast Mode" as primary custom agent example  
**Rationale**: Well-documented, accessible via installation badge, demonstrates advanced capabilities  
**Implementation**: Direct link integration in slides and lab instructions

### Assessment Rubric Framework

**Decision**: 5-point rubric covering completeness, project-specific context, actionable guidance  
**Rationale**: Aligns with trainer evaluation approach from clarification session  
**Framework**:
1. **Completeness** (1-5): Coverage of essential project context
2. **Specificity** (1-5): Project-specific vs. generic guidance  
3. **Actionability** (1-5): Clear, implementable instructions
4. **Technical Accuracy** (1-5): Correct tool/platform information
5. **Organization** (1-5): Logical structure and readability

### Learning Delivery Format Details

**Decision**: 40% presentations, 30% live demos, 30% guided practice  
**Rationale**: Balances theoretical foundation with hands-on experience  
**Time allocation**:
- Tools landscape overview: 45 minutes (presentation + demo)
- GitHub Copilot deep dive: 90 minutes (demo + practice)
- Model comparison: 30 minutes (presentation)
- Agent instruction files: 45 minutes (demo + practice)
- Labs: 3x 30-45 minutes each

## Information Currency Validation

All tool information verified against official documentation and current releases as of October 2025:
- GitHub Copilot: Latest VS Code extension features and CLI commands
- Alternative tools: Current availability and feature sets
- Custom agents: Verified installation methods and compatibility
- Model capabilities: Latest Claude, GPT, Gemini specifications

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Tool Access Issues**: Google Gemini as primary fallback, documented in assumptions  
**Version Compatibility**: Focus on stable, widely-adopted tool versions  
**Learning Pace Variations**: Flexible lab timing with core/advanced sections  
**Technical Prerequisites**: Pre-session tool setup guides and troubleshooting

## Next Phase Readiness

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items resolved. Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
