# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2 - Modern AI Coding Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met
**Validation Date**: October 12, 2025
**Validator**: GitHub Copilot

### Summary
The specification successfully meets all quality requirements:
- Contains no implementation details, maintaining focus on educational outcomes
- All functional requirements are testable and clearly defined
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios provide complete coverage of learning objectives
- Edge cases and assumptions are comprehensively documented
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phases

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All constitutional requirements from SFEIR School Coding with AI have been incorporated
- Module-scoped numbering (lab-21, lab-22, lab-23) follows constitutional standards
