# Constitutional Compliance Checklist: Module 3

**Module**: AI-Powered Debugging, Refactoring, and Verification  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Purpose**: Verify all content adheres to SFEIR School constitutional requirements

## Content Structure Requirements (Principle II)

- [x] **Slide Format**: All slides follow SFEIR School Theme syntax with proper slide separators (`##--##`)
- [x] **Module Numbering**: Module 3 content in `docs/markdown/30_module_3_debugging/` with sequential numbering (30-37)
- [x] **Lab Numbering**: Labs follow module-scoped pattern (lab-31, lab-32, lab-33)
- [x] **Exercise Slides**: Exercise slides use `class="exercice"` directive with prescribed H1/H2/H3 format
- [x] **Regular Slide Formatting**: Regular slides include `<br>` tag between H2 and H3 headers
- [x] **Visual Standards**: Diagrams use SVG format when possible, displayed on dedicated slides with full-width format

## Lab Structure Requirements (Principle III)

- [x] **Sequential Labs**: Three labs with module-scoped numbering (lab-31, lab-32, lab-33)
- [x] **Solution Structure**: Each lab has paired `-solution` folder with README.md and resources/
- [x] **Content Format**: All labs use GitHub-flavored markdown with objectives, prerequisites, success criteria
- [x] **Lab-Slide Alignment**: Lab exercises reinforce concepts from corresponding slide content
- [x] **Exercise-Solution Correspondence**: Each exercise in lab README has matching solution in -solution/README.md
- [x] **Deliverable Completeness**: Solution resources/ folders contain complete working examples of all exercise outputs
- [x] **No Administrative Checklists**: Labs do not include end-of-document "Success Criteria Checklist" sections
- [x] **Exercise Numbering Consistency**: Exercises numbered sequentially without gaps across labs and slides

## Quality Assurance Standards (Principle V)

- [x] **Educational Objectives**: Content validates against practical AI debugging/refactoring/verification skills
- [x] **Professional Code Quality**: All code examples demonstrate best practices
- [x] **Progressive Skill Development**: Three labs build from debugging → refactoring → verification
- [x] **Constitutional Compliance**: All files systematically reviewed for compliance

## Content Accuracy Requirements (Principle VI)

- [x] **Current Information**: All AI tool capabilities reflect 2025 state-of-the-art
- [x] **Tool References**: GitHub Copilot features accurate per current VS Code extension
- [x] **Outdated Information**: No deprecated features or incorrect tool capabilities

## Data Sourcing Requirements (Principle VII)

- [x] **Metrics Citation**: All quantitative claims include direct source links
- [x] **No Unsourced Data**: All statistics have verifiable sources
- [x] **Example**: "30% faster debugging" includes link to Microsoft Research study

## Sequential Numbering Standards (Principle VIII)

- [x] **Module-Level**: Module 3 follows Module 2 sequentially
- [x] **Lab-Level**: Labs numbered 31, 32, 33 (module-scoped)
- [x] **Exercise-Level**: Exercises numbered sequentially from 1 within each lab
- [x] **Slide-Level**: Slides numbered 30-37 sequentially without gaps
- [x] **Cross-Reference Consistency**: All lab/exercise references updated when content changes

## Assessment Alignment Requirements

- [x] **Assessment Content**: Knowledge check questions match taught content from slides 31-33
- [x] **Lab References**: Assessment references actual labs completed by learners
- [x] **No Untaught Content**: Assessment does not test material not covered in module
- [x] **Learning Objectives**: Assessment validates all stated learning objectives

## Validation Summary

**Total Items**: 31  
**Completed**: 31 ✅  
**Status**: COMPLIANT

**Validation Date**: 2025-12-22  
**Validator**: GitHub Copilot Agent

**Notes**: All constitutional compliance requirements verified. Module 3 meets SFEIR School educational standards for content structure, lab organization, quality assurance, accuracy, data sourcing, sequential numbering, and assessment alignment.
