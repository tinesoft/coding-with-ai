# Research: Module 1 Training Materials

## Overview
Research for comprehensive AI and prompt engineering training materials targeting beginner to intermediate developers for a 1-day course.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Presentation Framework
**Decision**: SFEIR School Theme (RevealJS-based)  
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with organizational standards
- Supports interactive presentations with code highlighting
- Mobile-responsive for various screen sizes
- Integrates with Nx workspace architecture
- Supports speaker notes and timing guidance
- Constitutional compliance requirement

**Alternatives considered**:
- PowerPoint/Keynote: Not web-native, limited interactivity
- Google Slides: Limited code formatting capabilities
- Custom HTML/CSS: Too much development overhead

### Educational Content Structure for AI/ML Topics

**Decision**: Progressive learning approach with theory→practice→assessment  
**Rationale**:
- Beginners need foundational concepts before hands-on practice
- AI/ML concepts are abstract and benefit from concrete examples
- Practical exercises reinforce theoretical understanding
- Assessment validates learning objectives

**Structure Pattern**:
1. **Conceptual Introduction** (10-15 minutes)
2. **Core Content** (20-30 minutes) 
3. **Hands-on Practice** (15-20 minutes)
4. **Assessment/Reflection** (5-10 minutes)

**Alternatives considered**: Project-first approach, theoretical deep-dive  
**Rejected because**: Too advanced for beginners, lack of practical application

### Prompt Engineering Teaching Methodologies

**Decision**: Iterative improvement methodology with real examples  
**Rationale**:
- Prompt engineering is learned through practice and iteration
- Real-world examples demonstrate practical applications
- Students learn by analyzing good vs. poor prompts
- Iterative refinement builds problem-solving skills

**Teaching Approach**:
1. **Show examples** of effective vs. ineffective prompts
2. **Demonstrate iteration** process for prompt improvement
3. **Provide templates** for common prompt patterns
4. **Practice exercises** with immediate feedback
5. **Reflection** on prompt effectiveness

**Alternatives considered**: Theoretical framework first, tool-specific training  
**Rejected because**: Too abstract for beginners, limits transferability

### Coding Education Lab Design

**Decision**: Scaffolded lab structure with progressive complexity  
**Rationale**:
- Students need guided practice before independent work
- Each lab builds on previous knowledge
- Clear instructions reduce cognitive load
- Solution files provide learning reference

**Lab Structure**:
```
lab-XX-topic/
├── README.md           # Instructions and objectives
├── exercises/          # Practice files
├── resources/          # Reference materials
└── validation/         # Success criteria

lab-XX-topic-solution/
├── README.md           # Explanation of solutions
├── completed/          # Finished exercises
└── notes/              # Teaching notes
```

**Alternatives considered**: Single large project, video-based tutorials  
**Rejected because**: Too overwhelming for beginners, passive learning

## Content Strategy

### Module 1 Learning Objectives
1. **Understand AI fundamentals**: LLMs, embeddings, RAG concepts
2. **Master prompt engineering**: Effective communication with AI systems
3. **Practice prompt iteration**: Systematic improvement techniques
4. **Introduction to tools**: Overview of AI coding assistants
5. **Safety awareness**: Understanding AI limitations and best practices

### Slide Organization (Sequential 10-19 numbering)
- **10_module1_intro.md**: Welcome, objectives, agenda
- **11_ai_fundamentals.md**: LLMs, embeddings, RAG explained
- **12_prompt_engineering.md**: Techniques, patterns, best practices
- **13_exercise_prompts.md**: Hands-on prompt writing practice
- **14_tools_and_agents.md**: AI coding tools introduction
- **15_assessment_and_recap.md**: Knowledge check and module summary

### Lab Progression
- **lab-01-prompt-basics**: Introduction to effective prompting techniques
- **lab-02-ai-fundamentals**: Hands-on exploration of AI concepts

## Implementation Decisions

### Content Delivery Format
**Decision**: Slides with embedded exercises and separate detailed labs  
**Rationale**: Maintains presentation flow while providing deep practice opportunities

### Visual Design Approach
**Decision**: Consistent SFEIR branding with AI-focused imagery  
**Rationale**: Professional appearance builds credibility, thematic images aid comprehension

### Assessment Strategy
**Decision**: Formative assessment through exercises, summative through capstone  
**Rationale**: Continuous feedback improves learning, final assessment validates competency

### Technology Integration
**Decision**: Live demonstrations integrated with theoretical content  
**Rationale**: Immediate application reinforces learning, builds confidence
