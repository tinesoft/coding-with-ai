# Tasks: Module 1: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-module-1-introduction/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: SFEIR School Theme (RevealJS), Nx Workspace, Vite, TypeScript 5.8.2
   → Structure: Educational content (slides in docs/markdown/, labs in labs/)
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: Extract 6 slide sections + 2 lab exercises defined
   → contracts/: content-quality.md + learning-validation.md contract tests
   → research.md: Technology decisions and SFEIR theme patterns
   → quickstart.md: 40-minute validation scenarios for integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: directory structure, configuration updates
   → Core: slide content creation, lab exercise development
   → Integration: slides.js updates, asset management, server validation
   → Polish: quality assurance, constitutional compliance, performance
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Structure before content creation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All slide sections created?
   → All lab exercises developed?
   → All integration scenarios validated?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Slides**: `docs/markdown/10_module_1_ai_fundamentals/` directory
- **Labs**: `labs/lab-01-prompt-basics/`, `labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals/` and solution directories
- **Assets**: `docs/assets/images/module-1/` for visual resources
- **Configuration**: `docs/scripts/slides.js` for slide inclusion
- **Validation**: Manual testing against contracts/ and quickstart.md scenarios

- [x] T008 Create `docs/markdown/10_module_1_ai_fundamentals/14_tools_and_agents.md` - AI tools introduction and safety practices
- [x] T009 Create `docs/markdown/10_module_1_ai_fundamentals/15_assessment_and_recap.md` - Knowledge validation and summary

### Lab Exercise Development (Parallel - different directories)
- [x] T010 [P] Create `labs/lab-01-prompt-basics/README.md` - Prompt writing exercises with clear instructions
- [x] T011 [P] Create `labs/lab-01-prompt-basics/exercises/` directory with practice templates and resources
- [x] T012 [P] Create `labs/lab-01-prompt-basics-solution/README.md` - Complete solutions and explanations
- [x] T013 [P] Create `labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals/README.md` - AI concepts exploration exercises  
- [x] T014 [P] Create `labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals/exercises/` directory with reference materials
- [x] T015 [P] Create `labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals-solution/README.md` - Solution guides and teaching notes

## Phase 3.3: Integration
- [x] T016 Update `docs/scripts/slides.js` to include all Module 1 slide files in correct sequence (10-15_*.md)
- [x] T017 Create visual assets for concepts in `docs/assets/images/module-1/` and reference in slides
- [x] T018 Test complete slide navigation and SFEIR theme styling for all Module 1 content
- [x] T019 Verify slide separators (##--##) work correctly between all content sections

## Phase 3.4: Polish
- [x] T020 [P] Execute quickstart.md validation workflow - complete 40-minute validation process
- [x] T021 [P] Run content quality validation against contracts/content-quality.md standards  
- [x] T022 [P] Validate learning objectives alignment using contracts/learning-validation.md criteria
- [x] T023 [P] Verify constitutional compliance for all Module 1 content organization

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before Core Implementation (T004-T015)
- Slide content (T004-T009) before Integration (T016-T019)
- Lab exercises (T010-T015) can run parallel with slides
- All implementation before Polish (T020-T025)
- T016 (slides.js) requires T004-T009 (slide files) to exist

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: Lab Development (T010-T015) - Parallel with Slide Creation
```bash
# While slides are being created sequentially, labs can be developed in parallel:
Task: "Create labs/lab-01-prompt-basics/README.md - Prompt writing exercises"
Task: "Create labs/lab-01-prompt-basics/exercises/ directory with practice templates" 
Task: "Create labs/lab-01-prompt-basics-solution/README.md - Complete solutions"
Task: "Create labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals/README.md - AI concepts exploration"
Task: "Create labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals/exercises/ directory with reference materials"
Task: "Create labs/lab-02-ai-fundamentals-solution/README.md - Solution guides"
```

### Phase 3.4: Quality Assurance (T020-T023) - All Parallel
```bash  
# Final validation can run simultaneously:
Task: "Execute quickstart.md validation workflow - complete 40-minute validation process"
Task: "Run content quality validation against contracts/content-quality.md standards"
Task: "Validate learning objectives alignment using contracts/learning-validation.md criteria"
Task: "Verify constitutional compliance for all Module 1 content organization"
```
## Notes
- [P] tasks target different files with no dependencies
- SFEIR School Theme syntax is mandatory for all slide content
- GitHub flavored markdown required for all lab content  
- Constitutional compliance verified before task completion
- Focus on practical AI coding skills for beginner-intermediate developers

## Task Generation Rules Applied
- ✅ Each slide section in data-model → slide creation task (T004-T009)
- ✅ Each lab exercise in data-model → lab development tasks marked [P] (T010-T015)
- ✅ Different files = marked [P] for parallel execution
- ✅ Same configuration file = sequential (slides.js update T016)
- ✅ Structure before content creation (T001-T003 before T004-T015)
