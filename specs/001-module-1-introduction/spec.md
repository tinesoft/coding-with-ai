## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Given the new constitution requirement for content accuracy as of September 2025, what validation process should be implemented for technical information? → A: Real-time validation during content creation process
- Q: The current spec mentions "measurable improvement in prompt quality" but doesn't define the measurement criteria. How should prompt quality improvements be quantified? → A: Before/after comparison of AI response quality and relevance
- Q: The edge cases mention "What if specific AI tools (Copilot, Claude) are unavailable during labs?" but no fallback strategy is specified. What should be the primary backup approach? → A: Alternative free AI tools with similar capabilities (ChatGPT Free, Gemini)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A trainer needs to deliver a comprehensive 1-day introduction to AI and prompt engineering for software developers. The trainer must have access to 6 structured slide segments, hands-on lab exercises, visual aids, and assessment tools that guide learners from basic AI concepts through practical prompt engineering skills and coding agent usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a trainer preparing for the course, **When** they access the training materials, **Then** they find complete slide decks, lab instructions, timing guides, and assessment rubrics for a 6-8 hour curriculum
2. **Given** learners with basic programming knowledge but mixed AI experience, **When** they complete Module 1, **Then** they can write effective prompts, understand AI fundamentals, and safely use coding assistants  
3. **Given** a trainer delivering the AI Fundamentals section, **When** they present slide 11, **Then** learners understand LLMs, embeddings, RAG, and practical AI applications in coding
4. **Given** learners in Lab 1, **When** they complete prompt engineering exercises, **Then** they demonstrate measurable improvement in prompt quality (minimum 2-point increase on 5-point rubric) through before/after comparison of AI response quality and relevance
5. **Given** a trainer conducting assessment, **When** they use provided evaluation materials, **Then** they can measure learner competency in prompt writing and AI tool usage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when learners have no prior AI experience?
- How does the course handle varying levels of programming expertise?
- What if specific AI tools (Copilot, Claude) are unavailable during labs? → Use alternative free AI tools with similar capabilities (ChatGPT Free, Gemini)
- How are different learning paces accommodated within the 6-8 hour timeframe?
