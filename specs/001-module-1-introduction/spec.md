## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Given the new constitution requirement for content accuracy as of September 2025, what validation process should be implemented for technical information? → A: Real-time validation during content creation process
- Q: The current spec mentions "measurable improvement in prompt quality" but doesn't define the measurement criteria. How should prompt quality improvements be quantified? → A: Before/after comparison of AI response quality and relevance
- Q: The edge cases mention "What if specific AI tools (Copilot, Claude) are unavailable during labs?" but no fallback strategy is specified. What should be the primary backup approach? → A: Alternative free AI tools with similar capabilities (ChatGPT Free, Gemini)

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: The course needs to accommodate "varying levels of programming expertise" among learners. What should be the approach for handling skill level differences during the 6-8 hour delivery? → A: Single track with optional advanced sections
- Q: For learners with "no prior AI experience," what level of foundational explanation should be provided before diving into practical exercises? → A: Comprehensive theory: 30-45 minutes covering AI history, types, and concepts
- Q: The course mentions a "5-point scoring rubric" for assessment. What should be the specific scoring scale definition for each rubric criterion? → A: 1=Unsatisfactory, 2=Needs Improvement, 3=Satisfactory, 4=Good, 5=Outstanding
- Q: The final edge case asks about accommodating "different learning paces within the 6-8 hour timeframe." What should be the primary strategy for time management? → A: Flexible timing: Allow sections to run over if needed, skip less critical content

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: For the visual aids required by FR-006 to illustrate complex AI concepts (LLMs, embeddings, RAG, prompt patterns), should these assets be created new, sourced from existing materials, or use a mixed approach? → A: Created new as part of Module 1 development (original SVG diagrams for all key concepts)
- Q: For the new SPEAR framework content (Scenario, Perspective, Examples, Action, Result) to be added after CLEAR framework, what should be the implementation scope: new dedicated slide file, extend existing prompt engineering slides, or separate advanced module? → A: Extend existing prompt engineering slides (12_prompt_engineering.md), create new SPEAR visual, and add SPEAR exercises to Lab 01

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A trainer needs to deliver a comprehensive 1-day introduction to AI and prompt engineering for software developers. The trainer must have access to 6 structured slide segments, hands-on lab exercises, visual aids, and assessment tools that guide learners from basic AI concepts through practical prompt engineering skills and coding agent usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a trainer preparing for the course, **When** they access the training materials, **Then** they find complete slide decks, lab instructions, timing guides, and assessment rubrics for a 6-8 hour curriculum
2. **Given** learners with basic programming knowledge but mixed AI experience, **When** they complete Module 1, **Then** they can write effective prompts, understand AI fundamentals, and safely use coding assistants  
3. **Given** a trainer delivering the AI Fundamentals section, **When** they present slide 11, **Then** learners understand LLMs, embeddings, RAG, and practical AI applications in coding
4. **Given** learners in Lab 1, **When** they complete prompt engineering exercises, **Then** they demonstrate measurable improvement in prompt quality (minimum 2-point increase on 5-point rubric) through before/after comparison of AI response quality and relevance
5. **Given** a trainer conducting assessment, **When** they use provided evaluation materials, **Then** they can measure learner competency in prompt writing and AI tool usage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when learners have no prior AI experience? → Provide 30-45 minutes of comprehensive foundational theory covering AI history, types, and concepts before practical exercises
- How does the course handle varying levels of programming expertise? → Single track with optional advanced sections for experienced developers
- What if specific AI tools (Copilot, Claude) are unavailable during labs? → Use alternative free AI tools with similar capabilities (ChatGPT Free, Gemini)
- How are different learning paces accommodated within the 6-8 hour timeframe? → Flexible timing approach: allow sections to run over if needed, skip less critical content to maintain core learning objectives
