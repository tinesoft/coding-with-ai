## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A trainer needs to deliver a comprehensive 1-day introduction to AI and prompt engineering for software developers. The trainer must have access to structured slide materials, hands-on lab exercises, visual aids, and assessment tools that guide learners from basic AI concepts through practical prompt engineering skills and coding agent usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a trainer preparing for the course, **When** they access the training materials, **Then** they find complete slide decks, lab instructions, timing guides, and assessment rubrics for a 7-hour curriculum
2. **Given** learners with basic TypeScript knowledge but mixed AI experience, **When** they complete Module 1, **Then** they can write effective prompts, understand AI fundamentals, and safely use coding assistants
3. **Given** a trainer delivering the AI Fundamentals section, **When** they present slides 11, **Then** learners understand LLMs, embeddings, RAG, and practical AI applications in coding
4. **Given** learners in Lab 01, **When** they complete prompt engineering exercises, **Then** they demonstrate measurable improvement in prompt quality and output effectiveness
5. **Given** a trainer conducting assessment, **When** they use provided evaluation materials, **Then** they can measure learner competency in prompt writing and AI tool usage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when learners have no prior AI experience?
- How does the course handle varying levels of programming expertise?
- What if specific AI tools (Copilot, Claude) are unavailable during labs?
- How are different learning paces accommodated within the 7-hour timeframe?

## Requirements
