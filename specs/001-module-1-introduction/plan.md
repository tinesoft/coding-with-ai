# Implementation Plan: Module 1: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering - Comprehensive Training Materials

**Branch**: `001-module-1-introduction` | **Date**: September 24, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-module-1-introduction/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Educational content project following SFEIR School constitutional structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - SFEIR School Theme specific markdown syntax patterns
   - RevealJS slide formatting best practices
   - Educational content structuring for AI/ML topics
   - Prompt engineering exercise design

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research SFEIR School Theme slide syntax patterns and RevealJS integration"
   Task: "Find best practices for AI/ML educational content structure"
   Task: "Research effective prompt engineering teaching methodologies"
   Task: "Analyze successful coding education lab design patterns"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with all technical and educational research complete

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract content entities** from feature spec → `data-model.md`:
   - Slide sections with learning objectives
   - Lab exercises with skill progression
   - Assessment criteria and success metrics

2. **Generate content contracts** from educational requirements:
   - Learning objective validation endpoints
   - Exercise completion criteria
   - Assessment rubrics and standards

3. **Generate validation tests** from contracts:
   - Content quality checks
   - Educational objective alignment tests
   - Constitutional compliance validation

4. **Extract learning scenarios** from user stories:
   - Developer learning journey validation
   - Hands-on exercise completion flows

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update .github/copilot-instructions.md with Module 1 context
   - Add SFEIR School Theme syntax guidance
   - Include educational content quality standards

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, validation checklists, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate content creation tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each slide section → slide creation task
- Each lab exercise → lab development task
- Each assessment → validation task
- Integration tasks for slides.js configuration

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Content-first order: Research → Slides → Labs → Validation
- Dependency order: Introduction → Core concepts → Practical exercises
- Sequential numbering following constitutional guidelines

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
