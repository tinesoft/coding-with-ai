    let user = users[i];
    let processed = {
      id: user.id,
      fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
      isActive: checkUserStatus(user.id), // Database call
      permissions: getUserPermissions(user.id), // Database call
      lastLogin: formatDate(user.lastLoginDate)
    };
    results.push(processed);
  }
  return results;
}
```

Performance Context:

## Exercise 6 Solution: SPEAR Framework Introduction

### Sample SPEAR Prompt for User Profile Endpoint

```
Scenario: I'm developing a REST API for a fitness tracking mobile app called "FitJourney" 
that serves 50,000+ daily active users. The backend needs to handle high read traffic 
(80% reads, 20% writes) with sub-200ms response times for profile data. We're using 
PostgreSQL for persistent storage and Redis for caching frequently accessed profiles.

Perspective: As a senior backend engineer with 7 years experience in Node.js, Express, 
and PostgreSQL, I prioritize scalability, security, and maintainability. I follow REST 
best practices and implement proper authentication/authorization patterns. I'm familiar 
with JWT tokens, rate limiting, and database optimization techniques.

Examples: Design this endpoint similar to GitHub's user API (GET /users/:username) 
structure but adapted for fitness data. Like Strava's profile endpoints, include 
nested resource capabilities (e.g., /users/:id/stats). Follow the response format 
pattern from JSONPlaceholder API with consistent error structures.

Action: Create a complete Node.js Express endpoint that:
- Handles GET /api/v1/users/:userId requests
- Authenticates using JWT middleware
- Retrieves user profile from PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- Returns structured JSON with profile data (name, email, age, fitness goals, privacy settings)
- Implements request validation and error handling
- Includes rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes per user)
- Uses TypeScript with strict types
- Adds appropriate HTTP status codes and headers

Result: Provide production-ready TypeScript code including:
1. Complete route handler with async/await
2. TypeScript interfaces for User, ProfileResponse, and ErrorResponse
3. Middleware for authentication and validation
4. Error handling that returns consistent JSON error format
5. JSDoc comments explaining security considerations
6. Example successful response (200) and error responses (400, 401, 404, 429)
7. Brief explanation of caching strategy implementation

Target output: 80-100 lines of well-commented, production-quality code.
```

## Exercise 7 Solution: CLEAR vs SPEAR Comparison

### Same Task, Two Frameworks

**Challenge**: Create a React data table with sorting and filtering

### CLEAR Framework Prompt

```
Context: I'm building an admin dashboard for an e-commerce platform. The dashboard 
needs to display product inventory data with interactive features.

Length: Provide a complete, production-ready component with full implementation 
(approximately 150-200 lines).

Examples: Similar to Material-UI DataGrid or AG-Grid functionality, but simpler. 
Include client-side sorting and filtering like Excel tables.

Audience: I'm an intermediate React developer (2 years experience) comfortable with 
hooks and TypeScript but new to complex table implementations.

Role: Act as a senior React developer who writes clean, maintainable code with 
comprehensive documentation.

Task: Create a React TypeScript component called ProductTable that:
- Accepts an array of product objects (id, name, category, price, stock)
- Implements column sorting (click headers to sort ascending/descending)
- Adds filtering input for each column
- Uses modern React hooks (useState, useMemo)
- Includes TypeScript interfaces
- Styles with CSS modules
- Handles edge cases (empty data, null values)
- Is fully accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
```

### SPEAR Framework Prompt

```
Scenario: I'm developing an inventory management dashboard for a mid-sized e-commerce 
company processing 500+ orders daily. The operations team needs to quickly find and 
analyze product data. Current Excel-based system is causing errors and inefficiency. 
The table will initially display 200-300 products with plans to scale to 1000+.

Perspective: As a React developer with strong UX sensibilities and experience building 
data-heavy interfaces, I prioritize performance, usability, and accessibility. I follow 
React best practices for hooks, memoization, and component composition. I'm comfortable 
with TypeScript and performance optimization techniques.

Examples: Design the interaction model similar to Airtable's table view (inline filtering, 
smooth sorting). Follow the performance patterns from react-window for large datasets. 
Use the filtering UX from Notion's database views (column-specific filter dropdowns).

Action: Build a ProductTable React component that:
- Renders 200-300 product rows efficiently
- Implements multi-column sorting with visual indicators
- Provides column-specific filtering (text search for name, dropdown for category, 
  number range for price/stock)
- Uses virtualization for performance with 1000+ rows
- Includes TypeScript for all props and state
- Handles loading states and empty states
- Implements keyboard shortcuts (arrow navigation, Enter to sort)
- Adds accessibility features (screen reader support, focus management)

Result: Deliver TypeScript code with:
1. Main ProductTable component
2. TypeScript interfaces for Product, TableProps, FilterState, SortState
3. Custom hooks: useTableSort, useTableFilter
4. Performance optimization explanations (useMemo, useCallback usage)
5. CSS module with responsive styling
6. Storybook-style usage examples showing different states
7. Performance considerations documentation (when to virtualize, debouncing)
8. Accessibility implementation notes

Target: 200-250 lines production-quality code, enterprise-ready.

## Exercise 8 Solution: Advanced SPEAR Application

### Scenario A Solution: Database Performance Optimization

```
Scenario: Our e-commerce platform "ShopFast" experiences severe database performance 
degradation during flash sales events. During our last "Black Friday Preview" sale 
with 2,500 concurrent users, average query response time jumped from 50ms to 3-8 seconds, 
causing 15% cart abandonment. Our PostgreSQL 14 database runs on AWS RDS (db.r5.2xlarge: 
8 vCPUs, 64GB RAM) serving a monolithic Rails application. The product catalog has 
500K SKUs, order history contains 5M records, and we see 95% read traffic vs 5% writes. 
Most problematic queries involve product search with filters, inventory checks, and 
order history retrieval.

Perspective: As a senior database architect with 12 years experience optimizing high-traffic 
PostgreSQL systems, I've solved similar issues at scale for companies like Shopify and Etsy. 
I specialize in query optimization, indexing strategies, connection pooling, caching layers, 
and read replica architectures. I prioritize solutions that provide immediate relief while 
building toward long-term scalability. I'm proficient in EXPLAIN ANALYZE, pg_stat_statements, 
and database performance monitoring tools.

Examples: Reference approaches similar to:
- Amazon's product search optimization using specialized indexes and query rewriting
- Shopify's read replica strategy for separating transactional and analytical queries
- Etsy's use of Redis for inventory count caching during high-traffic events
- Pinterest's approach to connection pooling and query timeout management

Action: Analyze our performance bottleneck and create a comprehensive optimization strategy:

1. Review these slow query patterns:
   - Product search: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name ILIKE '%keyword%' AND category_id IN (...) ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 20`
   - Inventory check: `SELECT quantity FROM inventory WHERE product_id = ? AND warehouse_id = ?`
   - Order history: `SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id WHERE o.user_id = ? ORDER BY o.created_at DESC`

2. Identify specific bottlenecks using EXPLAIN ANALYZE mindset

3. Propose concrete solutions for:
   - Index optimization (which columns, what types)
   - Query rewriting (better SQL patterns)
   - Caching strategy (what to cache, where, for how long)
   - Database configuration tuning
   - Read replica implementation if needed

4. Prioritize fixes by impact vs implementation effort

Result: Provide a detailed optimization plan including:

1. **Immediate Fixes** (implementable in 1-2 days):
   - Specific indexes to create (exact SQL commands)
   - Query rewrites with before/after comparison
   - Configuration changes with rationale
   - Expected performance improvement percentages

2. **Short-term Solutions** (1-2 weeks):
   - Redis caching implementation strategy
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Read replica setup for reporting queries

3. **Long-term Architecture** (1-3 months):
   - Database sharding strategy if needed
   - Elasticsearch integration for product search
   - CDN implementation for static data

4. **Monitoring & Validation**:
   - Which metrics to track
   - Alert thresholds to set
   - How to measure success

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Potential issues with each solution
   - Rollback strategies
   - Testing approach before flash sale

Format: Structured document with SQL examples, architecture diagrams (text-based), 
and step-by-step implementation guide. Include estimated performance improvements 
for each optimization.

Target: Production-ready plan that engineering team can execute immediately.
