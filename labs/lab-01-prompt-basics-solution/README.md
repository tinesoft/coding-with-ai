# Lab 1 Solution Guide: Prompt Engineering Basics

## Solution Overview
This guide provides sample solutions and detailed explanations for Lab 1 exercises. Remember that prompt engineering is contextual - your solutions may vary based on your specific needs and the AI tool you're using.

## Exercise 1 Solutions: From Vague to Clear

### Original Vague Prompt
```
"Help me with a login function"
```

### Sample AI Response to Vague Prompt
The AI will likely provide a very basic, generic response like:
```javascript
function login(username, password) {
    // Basic validation
    if (username && password) {
        // Simulate authentication
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Improved Prompt (CLEAR Framework Applied)

### Scenario B: Few-Shot Pattern (API Response Format)

#### Sample Prompt
```
"I need to generate consistent API response formats for my REST API. Here are examples of the desired structure:

Example 1 - Success Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user_123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  },

  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Example 2 - Error Response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "field": "email"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Example 3 - List Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "products": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 150
    }
  },
  "message": "Products retrieved successfully",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

- **Completeness**: 9/10 - Covers success, error, and list cases
- **Guidance**: 8/10 - Provides concrete examples to follow

### Scenario C: Chain-of-Thought Pattern (Performance Debugging)

#### Sample Prompt
```
"Help me debug the performance issue in this React component by following a systematic analysis:

Step 1: First, examine the component structure and identify any obvious performance anti-patterns (unnecessary re-renders, missing optimizations, expensive operations in render)

Step 2: Then, analyze the state management and effect dependencies to find potential infinite loops or excessive effect runs

Step 3: Next, evaluate the filtering and data processing logic for computational efficiency and optimization opportunities

Step 4: After that, consider React-specific optimizations (memoization, virtualization, lazy loading) that could be applied

Step 5: Finally, recommend specific code changes with expected performance impact and implementation priority

For each step, explain your reasoning and what you're looking for before moving to the next step.

Component code:
[Include the sample ProductList component from resources]

Current performance issue: The page becomes unresponsive when typing in the search box with 1000+ products."
```

    let user = users[i];
    let processed = {
      id: user.id,
      fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
      isActive: checkUserStatus(user.id), // Database call
      permissions: getUserPermissions(user.id), // Database call
      lastLogin: formatDate(user.lastLoginDate)
    };
    results.push(processed);
  }
  return results;
}
```

Performance Context:
- Processing arrays of 1000-5000 user objects
