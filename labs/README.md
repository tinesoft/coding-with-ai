# Labs Overview

This folder contains all hands-on exercises for the SFEIR School Coding with AI training. Each lab is designed to reinforce the concepts learned in the corresponding module and provide practical experience with AI coding tools and techniques.

## Lab Numbering System (Module-Scoped)

Labs use **module-scoped numbering** following the pattern: `lab-[MODULE_NUMBER][SEQUENCE]-{topic}`

- **MODULE_NUMBER**: Single digit (1-7) identifying the parent module
- **SEQUENCE**: Single digit (1, 2, 3...) identifying position within that module
- Lab numbering **RESETS to 1** for each new module

**Examples**: 
- Module 1 labs: `lab-11-{topic}`, `lab-12-{topic}`, `lab-13-{topic}`
- Module 2 labs: `lab-21-{topic}`, `lab-22-{topic}`, `lab-23-{topic}`

This ensures labs are clearly associated with their parent module.

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows a consistent structure:

- **Main Lab Directory** (`lab-XX-{topic}/`): Contains exercise instructions and starter files
- **Solution Directory** (`lab-XX-{topic}-solution/`): Contains complete solutions and explanations
  - **Optional Resources Folder**: May contain lab outputs and deliverables (e.g., final projects, code samples)
