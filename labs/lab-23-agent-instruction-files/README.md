## What Are AI Agent Instruction Files?

AI agent instruction files provide persistent context and guidelines to AI coding assistants. They help agents understand:
- Project architecture and organization
- Coding standards and conventions
- Development workflows
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Team preferences and best practices

### Common Instruction File Types

1. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - GitHub Copilot (both CLI and VS Code)
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Anthropic Claude (Claude.ai, CLI tools)
3. **`GEMINI.md`** - Google Gemini
4. **`AGENTS.md`** - Universal/multi-agent instructions
5. **`.cursorrules`** - Cursor IDE specific rules
6. **`.aiderignore` / `.aider.md`** - Aider CLI tool

## Exercise 3: Multi-Agent Instruction Files (10 minutes)

### Step 5: Create Universal Agent Instructions
**Objective:** Create an `AGENTS.md` file for use with multiple AI tools

**Rationale:** Different AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Aider) may not read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, but often look for common filenames like `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`.

**Instructions:**

1. Create `AGENTS.md` in your project root:
```bash
touch AGENTS.md
```

2. Structure for multi-agent compatibility:

```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

> This file provides context and guidelines for AI coding assistants including GitHub Copilot, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and other agents.

   - [ ] Verified AI agents understand new instructions
   ```

### Step 7: Test and Validate
**Objective:** Ensure instruction files improve AI agent performance

**Validation Checklist:**

1. **Basic Functionality:**
   - Ask agent about project structure â†’ Correct response?
   - Ask about coding standards â†’ Matches your guidelines?
   - Ask how to perform common task â†’ Correct procedure?

2. **Code Generation Quality:**
   - Generate a new component â†’ Follows your patterns?

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI agent doesn't seem to use instruction file

**Solutions:**
1. Check file is in correct location (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot)
2. Verify markdown formatting is correct
3. Reload VS Code window
4. Ensure file is not in `.gitignore`
5. Check file permissions (should be readable)

### Issue: Instructions are too generic

**Solutions:**
1. Add specific code examples from your project
2. Include actual file paths and structure
3. Document project-specific conventions
4. Add context about domain-specific concepts

### Issue: Instructions become outdated quickly

**Solutions:**
1. Keep instructions focused on stable patterns
2. Link to external docs for frequently changing details
3. Set up automated reminders for quarterly reviews
4. Include instruction file updates in architecture change PRs

### Issue: Different team members have different preferences

**Solutions:**
1. Establish team consensus on critical patterns
2. Document optional vs. required conventions
3. Use PR discussions to align on standards
4. Regular team reviews of instruction file content
