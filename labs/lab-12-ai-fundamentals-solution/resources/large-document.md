## 1. Frontend Development

### Component-Based Architecture

Modern frontend development relies heavily on component-based architectures. Components are reusable, self-contained units that encapsulate their own structure, behavior, and styling. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

**Key Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Props and State**: Components receive data through props and manage internal state
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Components go through mounting, updating, and unmounting phases
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex UIs by composing simple components

### State Management Patterns

State management becomes critical as applications grow in complexity. Various patterns and libraries have emerged to solve this challenge:

**Local State**: Managed within individual components using hooks like `useState` and `useReducer`. Suitable for component-specific data that doesn't need to be shared globally.

**Context API**: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling. Ideal for theme data, user authentication status, and other global configurations.

**Redux Pattern**: Implements a predictable state container with actions, reducers, and a single store. Best suited for large applications with complex state interactions.

**Server State Management**: Libraries like React Query and SWR handle server-side data caching, synchronization, and updates, treating server data as a separate concern from client state.

### Modern CSS Approaches

CSS has evolved significantly with new methodologies and tools:

**CSS Modules**: Provide local scope for styles, preventing naming conflicts and improving maintainability. Each component imports its own styles, and the bundler generates unique class names.

**CSS-in-JS**: Solutions like Styled Components and Emotion allow writing CSS directly in JavaScript files, enabling dynamic styling based on props and state.

**Utility-First CSS**: Frameworks like Tailwind CSS provide low-level utility classes that can be composed to build custom designs without writing custom CSS.

**CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Modern layout systems that provide powerful tools for creating responsive designs without relying on float-based layouts or positioning hacks.

## 2. Backend Architecture

### Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

The choice between microservices and monolithic architecture significantly impacts development, deployment, and maintenance:

**Monolithic Architecture:**
- Single codebase and deployment unit
- Easier to develop and test in early stages
- Simpler deployment process
- All components share the same technology stack
- Potential performance benefits from in-process communication

**Microservices Architecture:**
- Distributed system with independently deployable services
- Each service can use different technologies
- Better fault isolation
- Enables independent scaling of services
- More complex deployment and monitoring requirements

### RESTful API Design

REST (Representational State Transfer) remains the dominant architectural style for web APIs:

**HTTP Methods:**
- GET: Retrieve resources
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT: Update entire resources
- PATCH: Partial resource updates
- DELETE: Remove resources

**Best Practices:**
- Use nouns for resource names (e.g., /users, not /getUsers)
- Implement proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Version your API (e.g., /api/v1/users)
- Support filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Use HATEOAS for discoverability

### GraphQL Alternative

GraphQL offers an alternative to REST with several advantages:

- Clients specify exactly what data they need
- Single endpoint for all operations
- Strong typing system
- Introspection capabilities
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching

**Query Example:**
```graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Database Design

### Relational Database Concepts

Relational databases organize data into tables with defined relationships:

**Normalization**: Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy
- First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate repeating groups
- Second Normal Form (2NF): Remove partial dependencies
- Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminate transitive dependencies

**ACID Properties:**
- Atomicity: Transactions complete fully or not at all
- Consistency: Data remains in valid state
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- Durability: Committed changes persist

### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases provide alternatives to relational models:

**Document Databases** (MongoDB, CouchDB):
- Store data in JSON-like documents
- Flexible schema
- Suitable for content management, catalogs

**Key-Value Stores** (Redis, DynamoDB):
- Simple key-value pairs
- Extremely fast access
- Ideal for caching, sessions

**Column-Family Stores** (Cassandra, HBase):
- Store data in columns rather than rows
- Highly scalable
- Good for time-series data

**Graph Databases** (Neo4j, ArangoDB):
- Optimized for relationship queries
- Nodes and edges model
- Perfect for social networks, recommendations

## 4. API Development

### Authentication and Authorization

Security is paramount in API development:

**Authentication Methods:**
- **Basic Auth**: Username and password in headers (use HTTPS only)
- **API Keys**: Simple tokens for identification
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Self-contained tokens with claims
- **OAuth 2.0**: Delegated authorization framework

**JWT Structure:**
```
header.payload.signature
```

The header contains the algorithm, payload contains claims, and signature ensures integrity.

**Authorization Patterns:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)

### Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse and ensure fair usage:

**Strategies:**
- Fixed Window: Count requests in fixed time windows
- Sliding Window: More accurate but more complex
- Token Bucket: Allow bursts while limiting average rate
- Leaky Bucket: Smooth out traffic spikes

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting
- Return appropriate headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)
- Provide clear error messages when limits are exceeded

### API Documentation

Good documentation is essential for API adoption:

**OpenAPI/Swagger:**
- Industry-standard specification format
- Generate interactive documentation
- Support for code generation
- Validate requests and responses

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Include example requests and responses
- Document all parameters and their constraints
- Provide authentication examples
- Include error codes and their meanings
- Maintain versioning information

## 5. Testing Strategies

### Testing Pyramid

A well-balanced testing strategy includes multiple levels:

**Unit Tests** (Base of pyramid - most numerous):
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Fast execution
- Easy to write and maintain
- Mock external dependencies

**Integration Tests** (Middle layer):
- Test interactions between components
- Verify database operations
- Test API endpoints
- Validate service integrations

**End-to-End Tests** (Top of pyramid - fewest):
- Test complete user workflows
- Run against production-like environment
- Most comprehensive but slowest
- Catch integration issues

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD follows a red-green-refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing

**Benefits:**
- Better code design
- Higher test coverage
- Documentation through tests
- Confidence in refactoring

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD extends TDD with natural language specifications:

**Gherkin Syntax:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
    When they submit valid credentials
    Then they should be redirected to the dashboard
    And see a welcome message
```

## 6. Deployment Practices

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automate the software delivery pipeline:

**CI Pipeline Stages:**
1. Code commit triggers build
2. Run automated tests
3. Static code analysis
4. Build artifacts
5. Deploy to staging

**CD Pipeline Considerations:**
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Canary releases to minimize risk
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automated rollback mechanisms

### Containerization with Docker

Containers provide consistent environments across development and production:

**Dockerfile Best Practices:**
- Use official base images
- Minimize layers
- Leverage build cache
- Use multi-stage builds
- Don't run as root

**Docker Compose** for local development:
- Define multi-container applications
- Manage dependencies between services
- Simplify development environment setup

### Kubernetes Orchestration

Kubernetes manages containerized applications at scale:

**Key Concepts:**
- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units
- **Services**: Network abstraction for pods
- **Deployments**: Manage pod replicas
- **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Configuration management
- **Ingress**: HTTP routing to services

## 7. Security Considerations

### OWASP Top 10

Understanding common vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection**: SQL, NoSQL, OS command injection
2. **Broken Authentication**: Weak password policies, session management
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Insufficient encryption
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: XML processing vulnerabilities
5. **Broken Access Control**: Improper authorization checks
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Default settings, unnecessary features
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Exploiting object deserialization
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Lack of security visibility

### Input Validation

Never trust user input:

**Server-Side Validation:**
- Always validate on the server
- Use whitelist approach when possible
- Sanitize input before processing
- Validate data types and formats
- Implement length restrictions

**Client-Side Validation:**
- Provides immediate user feedback
- Never rely solely on client-side validation
- Can be bypassed easily
- Use for UX improvement only

### Encryption and Hashing

Protect sensitive data:

**Encryption:**
- HTTPS/TLS for data in transit
- AES-256 for data at rest
- Proper key management
- Regular key rotation

**Hashing:**
- bcrypt or Argon2 for passwords
- SHA-256 for data integrity
- Never store plain-text passwords
- Use salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
