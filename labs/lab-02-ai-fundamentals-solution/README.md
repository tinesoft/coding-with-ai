## Exercise 2 Solutions: Exploring Embeddings and Semantic Search

### Semantic Understanding Analysis

#### Code Similarity Recognition Results

**Test Case: Array Sum Functions**
```javascript
// Traditional loop
function sumArray(numbers) { /* ... */ }

// Functional approach  
const calculateTotal = (values) => values.reduce(/* ... */);

// Built-in method approach
const getMaximum = (values) => Math.max(...values);
```

**Expected AI Analysis**:
- **Semantic Purpose**: All functions process arrays to derive single values
- **Implementation Patterns**: Imperative vs. functional vs. declarative
- **Performance Characteristics**: Loop (explicit), reduce (functional), spread (built-in)
- **Maintainability**: Built-in > functional > imperative for readability

**Quality Indicators** (9/10 response):
- Identifies semantic similarity despite syntax differences
- Explains conceptual relationships
- Provides context-appropriate recommendations
- Demonstrates understanding beyond surface syntax

#### Variable Naming Semantic Recognition

**Test Case: User Data Access**
```javascript
function getUserById(id) { return database.users.findOne({ id }); }
function findPersonByIdentifier(identifier) { return db.people.getOne({ id: identifier }); }
function retrieveUserRecord(userId) { return userRepository.get(userId); }
```

**High-Quality AI Response Indicators**:
- **Semantic Grouping**: Recognizes all functions perform data retrieval
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies repository/DAO pattern variations
- **Naming Consistency**: Suggests standardization opportunities
- **Architectural Insights**: Discusses abstraction layer implications

#### Documentation Generation Quality

**Input Function**:
```javascript
function processData(input, config) {
  const filtered = input.filter(config.filterFn);
  const transformed = filtered.map(config.transformFn);
  const sorted = transformed.sort(config.sortFn);
  return sorted.slice(0, config.limit || 10);
}
```

**Excellent Documentation (9-10/10)**:
```javascript
/**
 * Processes a dataset through a configurable pipeline of operations.
 * 
 * This function implements a functional data processing pipeline that applies
 * filtering, transformation, and sorting operations in sequence, then returns
 * a limited subset of results. The pipeline is highly configurable through
 * the config object, making it suitable for various data processing scenarios.
 * 
 * @param {Array} input - The source dataset to process
 * @param {Object} config - Configuration object defining processing pipeline
 * @param {Function} config.filterFn - Predicate function for filtering items
 * @param {Function} config.transformFn - Transformation function for mapping items
 * @param {Function} config.sortFn - Comparison function for sorting items
 * @param {number} [config.limit=10] - Maximum number of items to return
 * 
 * @returns {Array} Processed and limited dataset
 * 
 * @example
 * const users = [
 *   { name: 'Alice', age: 30, active: true },
 *   { name: 'Bob', age: 25, active: false }
 * ];
 * 
 * const result = processData(users, {
 *   filterFn: user => user.active,
 *   transformFn: user => ({ ...user, displayName: user.name.toUpperCase() }),
 *   sortFn: (a, b) => b.age - a.age,
 *   limit: 5
 * });
 */
```

**Key Quality Indicators**:
- **Semantic Purpose**: Describes data pipeline concept
- **Usage Context**: Explains when and why to use
- **Parameter Semantics**: Explains purpose, not just types
- **Practical Examples**: Shows realistic usage scenarios

### Embeddings Application Insights

## Exercise 3 Solutions: Model Capabilities and Limitations

### Systematic Capability Assessment

#### Reasoning Capabilities Analysis

**Logic Puzzle Solution**: Debugging discount calculation

**High-Quality AI Analysis** (8-9/10):
```
Let me trace through this step-by-step:

1. **Input Analysis**: 
   - price: 150, customerType: 'premium', purchaseDate: December 20, 2024

2. **Initial Discount Calculation**:
   - Premium customer: discount = 0.15 (15%)

3. **Holiday Bonus Logic**:
   - purchaseDate.getMonth() = 11 (December)
   - holiday.getMonth() = 11 (December)  
   - Since they match: discount += 0.05 → discount = 0.20 (20%)

4. **Bulk Purchase Bonus**:
   - price (150) > 100: true
   - discount *= 1.2 → discount = 0.20 * 1.2 = 0.24 (24%)

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - return price * discount = 150 * 0.24 = 36

**Expected vs Actual**: Expected 22.5, Actual 30

**The Bug**: The issue is in the bulk purchase bonus logic. The code says 
"20% bonus on existing discount" but multiplies by 1.2, which actually 
means the discount becomes 120% of its original value (a 20% increase).

However, your expected result suggests you want the bulk bonus to be 
applied differently. Let me recalculate based on your expectation:

If expected is 22.5 from 150: 22.5/150 = 0.15 = 15%
This suggests no holiday bonus was applied in your expected calculation.

**Possible Issues**:
1. The holiday bonus logic might not work as expected
2. The bulk bonus calculation might be wrong
3. The expected result might be based on different logic

**Fix Options**:
```javascript
// Option 1: Fix holiday date comparison
const holiday = new Date('2024-12-25');
if (purchaseDate.getMonth() === holiday.getMonth() && 
    purchaseDate.getDate() <= 25) {

// Option 2: Fix bulk bonus calculation  
if (price > 100) {
  discount += 0.03; // Add 3% instead of multiply
}
```
```

**Key Indicators of Strong Reasoning**:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Step-by-step execution trace

### Creative Problem-Solving Analysis

**Real-time Code Collaboration Challenge**

**High-Quality AI Response Indicators**:
```
For real-time collaborative code editing, I'd recommend this approach:

**Core Architecture**:
1. **Operational Transformation (OT)** for conflict resolution
   - Transform operations based on concurrent changes
   - Maintain causal ordering of edits
   - Preserve user intent across transformations

2. **Syntax-Aware Collaboration**
   - Parse code into AST before applying changes
   - Validate syntax at transformation level
   - Block changes that break syntax rules

3. **Differential Synchronization**
   - Maintain shadow copies on client/server
   - Sync deltas rather than full documents
   - Implement backup sync for conflict recovery

**Technical Challenges**:

1. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Challenge: Two users edit same line simultaneously
   - Solution: OT with priority-based resolution
   - Fallback: Highlight conflicts for manual resolution

2. **Syntax Validity**:
   - Challenge: Edits that break code structure
   - Solution: Real-time AST validation
   - Strategy: Temporary syntax errors with healing

3. **Performance at Scale**:
   - Challenge: 10k+ line files with multiple editors
   - Solution: Lazy loading with viewport-based sync
   - Optimization: Delta compression and batching

**Implementation Strategy**:
```javascript
class CollaborativeEditor {
  constructor() {
    this.operationalTransform = new OTEngine();
    this.syntaxValidator = new LanguageParser();
    this.conflictResolver = new ConflictEngine();
  }
  
  async applyEdit(operation, userId) {
    // 1. Transform operation against concurrent changes
    const transformedOp = await this.operationalTransform
      .transform(operation, this.getPendingOperations());
    
    // 2. Validate syntax impact
    const syntaxValid = await this.syntaxValidator
      .validateOperation(transformedOp);
    
    if (!syntaxValid) {
      return this.handleSyntaxConflict(transformedOp, userId);
    }
    
    // 3. Apply and broadcast
    this.document.apply(transformedOp);
    this.broadcastToCollaborators(transformedOp, userId);
  }
}
```

**Offline Capability**:
- Local operation queue with timestamp ordering
- Merge conflict detection on reconnection
- Three-way merge with server state, local state, base state

This solution balances real-time performance with data consistency,
providing a robust foundation for collaborative coding.
```

    const user = await this.db.users.findOne({ id });
    
    // Cache successful results for future requests
    if (user) {
      this.cache.set(id, user);
    }
    
    return user;
  }
}
```
