# Specification-Driven Development

## **From Requirements to Code**

### **Traditional Approach**
```
Requirement → Developer interpretation → Code → Debug → Refactor
```

### **Spec-Driven Approach**
```
Detailed Specification → AI Implementation → Human Review → Iterate
```

# Writing Effective Specifications

## **Specification Template**

```yaml
# Project Specification Template

## Overview
- **Objective**: Clear, measurable goal
- **Scope**: What's included and excluded
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion

## Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Specific versions and frameworks
- **Architecture**: Patterns and design principles
- **Performance**: Response times, load requirements
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

## Functional Requirements
- **User Stories**: As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- **API Endpoints**: Method, path, request/response format
- **Data Models**: Entities, relationships, validation rules
- **Business Logic**: Rules, calculations, workflows

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Standards, patterns, documentation
- **Testing**: Coverage requirements, test types
- **Deployment**: Environment configuration, CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerting
```

# Spec-Driven AI Development Example

## **Specification Example**

```yaml
Feature: User Authentication System

Objective: Implement secure JWT-based authentication
Technology: React + TypeScript + Express + MongoDB

Functional Requirements:
  Authentication:
    - POST /api/auth/register (email, password, name)
    - POST /api/auth/login (email, password)
    - POST /api/auth/logout (JWT token)
    - GET /api/auth/me (JWT token) → user profile

  Validation:
    - Email: Valid format, unique in database
    - Password: Min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special
    - Name: 2-50 characters, no special characters

  Security:
    - JWT tokens expire in 24 hours
    - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
    - Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per minute per IP
    - HTTPS only in production

  Error Handling:
    - 400: Validation errors with specific field messages
    - 401: Invalid credentials or expired token
    - 429: Rate limit exceeded
    - 500: Internal server errors (logged, generic message)

Code Quality:
  - TypeScript strict mode
  - ESLint + Prettier configuration
  - 90%+ test coverage
  - JSDoc for all public functions
```

Notes:
Specification-driven development with AI transforms how we build software. Instead of writing code line by line, we write detailed specifications and let AI agents implement them, ensuring consistency, quality, and alignment with requirements.
