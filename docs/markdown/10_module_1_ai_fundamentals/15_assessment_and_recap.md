# **Knowledge Check: AI Fundamentals**

## **Quick Quiz** (2 minutes each)

### **Question 1**: What does "RAG" stand for and why is it important?
**A)** Random Access Generation - for faster AI responses  
**B)** Retrieval Augmented Generation - for accessing current information  
**C)** Recursive Algorithm Generation - for complex problem solving  
**D)** Real-time AI Guidance - for live coding assistance

### **Question 2**: Which component is most crucial for LLM performance?
**A)** Processing speed  
**B)** Training data quality and quantity  
**C)** Hardware specifications  
**D)** User interface design

*Think about your answers, we'll discuss them next!*

Notes:
These questions test your understanding of core AI concepts that underpin all the tools and techniques we'll use throughout the course.

##--##

<!-- .slide: -->
# **Knowledge Check: Answers**

## **Answer 1**: **B** - Retrieval Augmented Generation
RAG allows AI models to access external, up-to-date information by retrieving relevant documents before generating responses. This solves the "knowledge cutoff" problem.

## **Answer 2**: **B** - Training data quality and quantity
While all factors matter, the foundation of any LLM's capabilities comes from the quality, diversity, and quantity of its training data. This determines what the model can understand and generate.

## **üí° Key Insight**
Understanding these fundamentals helps you:
- Choose the right AI tool for specific tasks
- Set realistic expectations for AI capabilities
- Troubleshoot when AI responses aren't meeting your needs

Notes:
These aren't just theoretical concepts - they directly impact how you use AI tools in practice. RAG explains why AI can help with recent technologies, and training data quality explains why some models excel at certain programming languages.

# **Prompt Engineering Assessment**

## **Practical Challenge**: Fix This Prompt

### **Scenario**: You need a React component for user authentication

### **Poor Prompt**:
```
"Create a login component"
```

### **Your Task** (3 minutes):
Apply the CLEAR framework to improve this prompt:
- **C**ontext: What's the larger application context?
- **L**ength: How detailed should the response be?
- **E**xamples: What examples would help?
- **A**udience: What's your skill level?
- **R**ole: What role should the AI assume?

*Work individually, then we'll compare solutions*

Notes:
This practical exercise tests your ability to apply the CLEAR framework in a realistic scenario. There's no single "correct" answer, but good solutions will show clear application of the framework principles.

##--##

<!-- .slide: -->
# **Prompt Engineering: Sample Solution**

## **Improved Prompt Using CLEAR**:

```
"As a senior React developer, help me create a user authentication 
component for a TypeScript e-commerce application. 

I need a LoginForm component that includes:
- Email and password input fields with validation
- Submit handling with loading states
- Error display for failed authentication
- Integration with React Hook Form and Yup validation
- Styled using Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript interfaces for props and form data

Please provide:
1. The complete component code
2. TypeScript interfaces
3. A simple usage example
4. Basic error handling patterns

Target audience: Mid-level React developers
Expected length: 50-80 lines of code with comments"
```

Notes:
Notice how this version eliminates ambiguity and provides specific constraints. The AI now knows exactly what to build, how to build it, and what additional information to provide.

# **Pattern Recognition Assessment**

## **Match the Pattern to the Use Case**

### **Patterns**: Role-Based, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Constraint-Based

### **Use Cases**:
1. **Debugging a complex performance issue** ‚Üí ?
2. **Generating API response examples** ‚Üí ?
3. **Code review from security perspective** ‚Üí ?
4. **Database query with specific requirements** ‚Üí ?

### **Your Turn**:
Match each use case with the most appropriate pattern and explain why.

**Time: 2 minutes thinking + 3 minutes discussion**

Notes:
Pattern recognition is crucial for effective prompt engineering. Each pattern serves specific purposes and understanding when to use which pattern dramatically improves your AI interactions.

##--##

<!-- .slide: -->
# **Pattern Recognition: Solutions**

## **Correct Matches**:

1. **Debugging a complex performance issue** ‚Üí **Chain-of-Thought**  
   *Reasoning*: Systematic analysis requires step-by-step thinking

2. **Generating API response examples** ‚Üí **Few-Shot**  
   *Reasoning*: Examples demonstrate the desired format and structure

3. **Code review from security perspective** ‚Üí **Role-Based**  
   *Reasoning*: Security expertise requires specialized knowledge and perspective

4. **Database query with specific requirements** ‚Üí **Constraint-Based**  
   *Reasoning*: Clear boundaries and requirements guide the solution

## **üí° Pro Tip**:
You can combine patterns! For example: Role-based + Chain-of-thought for expert-level systematic analysis.

Notes:
Understanding these patterns helps you structure prompts more effectively. The patterns aren't mutually exclusive - experienced prompt engineers often combine multiple patterns for complex tasks.

# **Tool Selection Assessment**

## **Scenario-Based Decision Making**

### **Team Scenarios** (Choose the best AI tool):

**Scenario A**: Solo developer, budget-conscious, learning React  
**Options**: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Free, Cursor, Continue

**Scenario B**: Enterprise team, security-sensitive project, VS Code  
**Options**: GitHub Copilot Business, Local AI model, Codeium Teams

**Scenario C**: Open-source contributor, multiple IDEs, customization needs  
**Options**: Continue, Codeium, Local LLM, ChatGPT

### **Consider**: Cost, Security, Integration, Features

**Time: 2 minutes per scenario**

Notes:
Tool selection depends on context. There's no universally "best" tool - the right choice depends on budget, security requirements, team size, and workflow preferences.

##--##

<!-- .slide: -->
# **Tool Selection: Recommendations**

## **Scenario Solutions**:

### **A: Solo + Budget + Learning**
**‚úÖ ChatGPT Free** + **Codeium Free**
