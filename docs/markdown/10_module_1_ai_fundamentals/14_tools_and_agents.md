# **AI Agent Capabilities**

## **What AI Agents Can Do**
- 📝 **Code Generation**: Functions, classes, modules
- 🔍 **Code Analysis**: Review, optimization, security scanning
- 🐛 **Debugging**: Error analysis and fix suggestions
- 📖 **Documentation**: API docs, comments, README files
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Design patterns and structure advice
- 🧪 **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data

## **What They Can't Do (Yet)**
- ❌ **Complex Business Logic**: Domain-specific requirements
- ❌ **Full Application Architecture**: End-to-end system design
- ❌ **Production Deployment**: Infrastructure and DevOps
- ❌ **Real-time Collaboration**: Team coordination
- ❌ **Creative Problem Solving**: Novel algorithmic solutions

Notes:
Understanding both capabilities and limitations is crucial for effective AI tool usage. AI excels at well-defined, pattern-based tasks but struggles with complex, context-dependent decisions.

# **Practical Integration Strategies**

## **The AI-Human Development Workflow**

### **1. Exploration Phase**
- Use AI for research and learning new technologies
- Generate prototype code for proof-of-concepts
- Explore different implementation approaches

### **2. Development Phase**
- AI generates boilerplate and repetitive code
- Human provides business logic and domain expertise
- Collaborative refinement through iterative prompting

### **3. Review Phase**
- AI assists with code review and optimization
- Human validates correctness and maintainability
- Combined testing strategies (AI-generated + human-designed)

Notes:
The most effective AI integration treats AI as a powerful assistant, not a replacement. The key is knowing when to lead and when to delegate to AI.
