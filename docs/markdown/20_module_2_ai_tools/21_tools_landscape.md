# The Evolution of Development Tools

## From Text Editors to AI Assistants

<br>

### **Traditional Workflow**
```
IDE + Extensions + Documentation + Stack Overflow
```

### **AI-Enhanced Workflow**
```
IDE + AI Agent + Context-Aware Assistance + Real-time Code Generation
```

<br>

> **Key Insight**: AI coding tools don't replace your skills‚Äîthey amplify them

Notes:
The landscape of development tools has rapidly evolved with AI integration, creating new categories of tools that enhance developer productivity.
