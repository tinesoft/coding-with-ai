- **Custom Instructions**: Personalized responses based on your preferences
- **Agents**: Specialized assistants for terminal, VS Code, and GitHub

### **Example Usage**
```
You: "How do I implement a binary search in Python?"
Copilot: [Provides implementation with explanation]
You: "Can you make it recursive?"
Copilot: [Modifies to recursive approach]
```

Notes:
Ask mode is perfect for learning and exploration, providing explanations and context that help you understand the "why" behind code suggestions.

# Copilot Edits

## Multi-File Natural Language Editing

<br>

### **When to Use Copilot Edits**
- Refactoring across multiple files
- Implementing features with natural language descriptions
- Making consistent changes across your codebase
- Converting between frameworks or languages

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-File Editing**: Modify multiple files simultaneously
- **Natural Language Instructions**: Describe changes in plain English
- **Preview Mode**: Review all changes before applying
- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzes file relationships and dependencies

### **Example Workflow**
1. Open Copilot Edits panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Describe desired changes: "Add TypeScript types to all API functions"
3. Review proposed changes across multiple files
4. Accept or reject individual changes

Notes:
Edit mode transforms your coding experience by predicting what you want to write next, significantly speeding up development.

# Copilot Spaces

## Organized Context for Development Tasks

<br>

### **When to Use Copilot Spaces**
- Planning new features or major changes
- Understanding large or unfamiliar codebases
- Creating comprehensive implementation plans
- Coordinating changes across multiple systems
- Implementing feature specifications
- Batch operations across codebase

### **Key Features**
- **Context Organization**: Centralize relevant code, docs, and specs in one place
- **Focused Assistance**: Ground Copilot responses in project-specific context
- **Team Collaboration**: Share spaces to reduce handoffs and repeated questions
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintain context across development sessions

### **Example Workflow**
1. Create a space at github.com/copilot/spaces
2. Add relevant code files, documentation, and specifications
3. Provide context instructions for the development task
4. Ask Copilot questions grounded in your space's context
5. Share with team members for consistent knowledge access

Notes:
Copilot Spaces help organize and centralize relevant content for specific development tasks, enabling better context-aware assistance from Copilot.

# Custom Instructions

## Personalizing Your AI Assistant

<br>

### **What are Custom Instructions?**
Persistent preferences that shape how Copilot responds to you

### **Setup Process**
1. Open VS Code settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "copilot instructions"
3. Add your preferences in natural language
4. Save and restart VS Code for full effect

### **Example Instructions**
- "Use TypeScript with strict mode and functional programming patterns"
- "Always include error handling and input validation"
- "Prefer modern ES6+ syntax and avoid jQuery"
- "Follow React hooks patterns and avoid class components"

### **Benefits**
- **Consistent Style**: Maintains your coding preferences across projects
- **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporates your specific frameworks and patterns
- **Team Standards**: Enforces organizational coding guidelines

Notes:
Custom instructions transform Copilot from a generic assistant into a personalized pair programmer that understands your specific preferences and constraints.

# Workflow Integration Patterns

## Combining Modes Effectively

<br>

### **Discovery ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Refinement**
1. **Ask Mode**: "How should I approach this problem?"
2. **Edit Mode**: Implement solution with inline assistance
3. **Agent Mode**: Refactor and optimize across files

### **Learning ‚Üí Doing ‚Üí Scaling**
1. **Ask Mode**: Learn new concepts and patterns
2. **Edit Mode**: Practice with guided assistance
3. **Agent Mode**: Apply to larger-scale implementations

### **Planning ‚Üí Coding ‚Üí Review**
1. **Agent Mode**: Generate implementation plan
2. **Edit Mode**: Write code with contextual help
3. **Ask Mode**: Review and explain complex sections

Notes:
The most effective developers use all three modes synergistically, leveraging each mode's strengths for different phases of development.

# Restore Points & Version Control

## Safe AI Experimentation

<br>

### **GitHub Copilot Chat Restore Points**
- **Automatic Snapshots**: Save state before major changes
- **Manual Checkpoints**: Create restore points on demand
- **Quick Rollback**: Revert to previous state instantly
- **Branch Integration**: Works with Git branching strategies

### **Best Practices**
- Create restore points before experimental changes
- Use descriptive names for manual checkpoints
- Combine with Git commits for comprehensive versioning
- Test AI-generated code before committing

### **Example Workflow**
```bash
# Create restore point
copilot restore create "before-refactoring"

# Make AI-assisted changes
copilot agent "refactor for performance"

# If issues arise, restore
copilot restore apply "before-refactoring"
```

Notes:
Restore points provide safety nets for AI experimentation, allowing you to explore solutions without fear of breaking working code.
