# Copilot (IDE Extension) - Ask Mode

## Multi-Turn Conversational AI Assistant

<br>

### **When to Use Ask Mode**
- Complex problem-solving and architecture discussions
- Code review and security analysis
- Learning new frameworks or best practices
- Debugging with full repository context

### **Key Features**
- **Repository Context**: Analyzes entire codebase for relevant answers
- **Web Search**: Access to current documentation and Stack Overflow
- **Custom Agent Configuration**: Personalized responses based on your preferences
- **Specialized Agents**: Terminal, VS Code, and GitHub assistants

Notes:
Ask mode is perfect for learning and exploration, providing explanations and context that help you understand the "why" behind code suggestions.

# Copilot (IDE Extension) - Edit Mode

## Multi-File Natural Language Editing

<br>

### **When to Use Edit Mode**
- Refactoring across multiple files
- Implementing features with natural language descriptions
- Making consistent changes across your codebase
- Converting between frameworks or languages

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-File Editing**: Modify multiple files simultaneously
- **Natural Language Instructions**: Describe changes in plain English
- **Preview Mode**: Review all changes before applying
- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzes file relationships and dependencies


Notes:
Edit mode transforms your coding experience by enabling direct code modifications across multiple files based on natural language instructions.


### **Example Workflow**
1. Open Edit Mode panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Describe desired changes: "Add TypeScript types to all API functions"
3. Review proposed changes across multiple files
4. Accept or reject individual changes

# Copilot (IDE Extension) - Agent Mode

## Autonomous Task Execution with Oversight

<br>

### **When to Use Agent Mode**
- Planning new features or major changes
- Understanding large or unfamiliar codebases
- Creating comprehensive implementation plans
- Coordinating changes across multiple systems
- Implementing feature specifications
- Complex multi-step development workflows

### **Key Features**
- **Autonomous Execution**: AI handles multi-step tasks with human oversight
- **Context Organization**: Centralizes relevant code, docs, and specs
- **Approval Gates**: Review and approve actions before execution
- **Team Collaboration**: Share context to reduce handoffs and repeated questions
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains context across development sessions

Notes:
Agent Mode enables autonomous task execution while maintaining human oversight through approval gates, perfect for complex multi-step development workflows.
### **Example Workflow**
1. Initiate Agent Mode in your IDE or at github.com/copilot/spaces
2. Add relevant code files, documentation, and specifications
3. Provide task instructions and acceptance criteria
4. Review proposed actions at approval gates
5. Share context with team members for consistent knowledge access

# Copilot (VSCode Extension) - Custom Agent Mode

## Personalizing Your AI Assistant

<br>

### **What is Custom Agent Mode?**
Persistent preferences and project-specific instructions that shape how Copilot responds to you

### **Setup Process**
1. Open VS Code settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "copilot instructions"
3. Add your preferences and project context in natural language
4. Save and restart VS Code for full effect

##--##

<!-- .slide: -->
# Copilot (VSCode Extension) - Custom Agent Mode

## Personalizing Your AI Assistant

<br>

### **Example Instructions**
- "Use TypeScript with strict mode and functional programming patterns"
- "Always include error handling and input validation"
- "Prefer modern ES6+ syntax and avoid jQuery"
- "Follow React hooks patterns and avoid class components"

### **Benefits**
- **Consistent Style**: Maintains your coding preferences across projects
- **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporates your specific frameworks and patterns
- **Team Standards**: Enforces organizational coding guidelines

Notes:
Custom Agent Mode transforms Copilot from a generic assistant into a personalized pair programmer that understands your specific preferences, project context, and constraints.

# Workflow Integration Patterns

## Combining Modes Effectively

<br>

### **Discovery ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Refinement**
1. **Ask Mode**: "How should I approach this problem?"
2. **Edit Mode**: Implement solution with inline assistance
3. **Agent Mode**: Refactor and optimize across files

### **Learning ‚Üí Doing ‚Üí Scaling**
1. **Ask Mode**: Learn new concepts and patterns
2. **Edit Mode**: Practice with guided assistance
3. **Agent Mode**: Apply to larger-scale implementations

### **Planning ‚Üí Coding ‚Üí Review**
1. **Agent Mode**: Generate implementation plan
2. **Edit Mode**: Write code with contextual help
3. **Ask Mode**: Review and explain complex sections

Notes:
The most effective developers use all three modes synergistically, leveraging each mode's strengths for different phases of development.
