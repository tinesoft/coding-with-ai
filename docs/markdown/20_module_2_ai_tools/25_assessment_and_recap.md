# Knowledge Check: Answers

## Answer 1: **B** - CLI agents
CLI agents like GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex, and Gemini CLI are optimized for terminal operations, providing quick assistance with Git commands, shell scripts, and command-line workflows without leaving the terminal.

## Answer 2: **C** - Autonomous task execution with oversight
Agent mode allows GitHub Copilot to execute multi-step tasks autonomously while maintaining human oversight through approval gates. It's more powerful than chat or inline completions for complex development tasks.

## Answer 3: **C** - Gemini 2.5 Pro (2M tokens)
Gemini 2.5 Pro offers a massive 2 million token context window, significantly larger than Claude 4.x (200K), GPT-5 (128K), and DeepSeek Coder (128K). This enables analysis of entire large codebases in a single context.

## üí° Key Insight
Understanding tool capabilities and model differences helps you choose the optimal AI assistant for each development scenario, maximizing productivity and code quality.

Notes:
These aren't just facts to memorize - they guide practical decisions about which tools to use in your daily development workflow.
