# Exercise 5: AI Testing & Quality
## **Hands-on Lab**

### **Objectives**
- Set up AI-powered testing tools
- Generate comprehensive test suites
- Implement quality gates with AI
- Monitor code quality metrics

### **Tasks**
1. **Install AI testing tools** (GitHub Copilot, Jest AI, SonarQube)
2. **Generate unit tests** for existing functions using AI
3. **Set up automated quality checks** in your CI/CD pipeline
4. **Create test coverage reports** and analyze gaps
5. **Implement AI code review** in pull requests

### **Step: lab-05-testing**

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

Notes:
This exercise demonstrates practical implementation of AI testing and quality assurance tools in a real development workflow. Focus on understanding how AI can enhance rather than replace traditional testing practices.
