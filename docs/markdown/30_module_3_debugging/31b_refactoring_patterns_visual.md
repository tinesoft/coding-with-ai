# Refactoring Patterns Overview

![h-900 center](./assets/images/module-3/refactoring-patterns.svg)

Notes:
This visual summarizes the five core refactoring patterns you'll practice in the hands-on lab. Each pattern addresses a specific code quality issue and follows a clear before-and-after transformation. Notice how these patterns complement each other - for example, after extracting methods, you might rename them for clarity, then modernize their syntax. The benefits cascade: better readability leads to easier maintenance, which reduces bugs and improves team velocity. Remember the golden rule at the bottom: always refactor with tests, tackle one pattern at a time, and commit your changes frequently to maintain a safety net.
