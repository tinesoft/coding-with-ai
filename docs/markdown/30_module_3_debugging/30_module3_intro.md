# Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

<br>

- **Master** systematic debugging workflows with AI assistance
- **Apply** refactoring patterns using AI-powered tools
- **Evaluate** AI-generated code critically for correctness and security
- **Implement** human-in-the-loop validation techniques
- **Detect** hallucinations, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors in AI code

Notes:
This module teaches you to leverage AI tools effectively for debugging, refactoring, and verifying code while maintaining professional standards and critical thinking.

# Prerequisites

## What You Need to Know

<br>

### **From Modules 1 & 2**
- AI fundamentals and prompt engineering techniques
- GitHub Copilot familiarity (Ask, Edit, and Agent modes)
- AI safety and limitation awareness

### **Technical Requirements**
- Python or JavaScript/TypeScript programming experience
- Understanding of basic debugging concepts
- Code quality and testing awareness
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot installed

Notes:
If you're comfortable with basic programming and have completed the first two modules, you're ready for Module 3.

# **Learning Approach**

## **Human-in-the-Loop Methodology**
<br>

### **AI as Assistant, Not Replacement**

- **You lead**: Define problems, validate solutions
- **AI accelerates**: Suggests fixes, patterns, improvements
- **You decide**: Accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions

### **Critical Thinking Required**
Every AI suggestion must be verified and understood

Notes:
This approach builds competency and prevents over-reliance on AI tools. You'll learn when to trust AI and when to question it.

# **Success Criteria**

## **What Success Looks Like**
<br>

### **By End of Module, You Can:**

- Debug systematically with AI and explain root causes
- Apply appropriate refactoring patterns confidently
- Identify 7 types of issues in AI-generated code
- Make informed decisions about AI suggestions

### **✓ Pass knowledge check (80%)**
### **✓ Complete all 3 lab exercises**

Notes:
Success means you can independently apply these skills to your own projects with confidence.
