# **Module 3 Overview**

## **AI-Powered Debugging, Refactoring, and Verification**
<br>

### **Learning Objectives**

- Master systematic debugging with AI assistance
- Apply refactoring patterns using AI tools
- Critically evaluate AI-generated code
- Build human-in-the-loop validation skills

Notes:
This module teaches you to leverage AI tools effectively for debugging, refactoring, and verifying code while maintaining professional standards and critical thinking.

# **What You'll Learn**

## **Three Core Skills**
<br>

### **1. AI-Assisted Debugging**
Debug faster and smarter using AI to identify root causes

### **2. Code Refactoring**
Improve code quality with AI-suggested refactoring patterns

### **3. Code Verification**
Detect hallucinations, security issues, and logic errors in AI code

Notes:
Each skill builds on systematic workflows where AI acts as an accelerator, not a replacement for your expertise.

# **Why This Matters**

## **Real-World Impact**
<br>

### **🚀 Faster Development**
Resolve bugs [30-50% faster](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ai-assisted-debugging/) with AI assistance

### **✅ Better Code Quality**
Systematic refactoring improves maintainability

### **🔒 Enhanced Security**
Critical evaluation prevents AI-generated vulnerabilities

Notes:
These skills translate directly to professional productivity and code safety in production environments.

# **Learning Approach**

## **Human-in-the-Loop Methodology**
<br>

### **AI as Assistant, Not Replacement**

- **You lead**: Define problems, validate solutions
- **AI accelerates**: Suggests fixes, patterns, improvements
- **You decide**: Accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions

### **Critical Thinking Required**
Every AI suggestion must be verified and understood

Notes:
This approach builds competency and prevents over-reliance on AI tools. You'll learn when to trust AI and when to question it.

# **Success Criteria**

## **What Success Looks Like**
<br>

### **By End of Module, You Can:**

- Debug systematically with AI and explain root causes
- Apply appropriate refactoring patterns confidently
- Identify 7 types of issues in AI-generated code
- Make informed decisions about AI suggestions

### **✓ Pass knowledge check (80%)**
### **✓ Complete all 3 lab exercises**

Notes:
Success means you can independently apply these skills to your own projects with confidence.
