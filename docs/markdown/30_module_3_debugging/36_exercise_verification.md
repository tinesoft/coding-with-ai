Notes:
In this final hands-on exercise, you'll apply the seven-point verification checklist to AI-generated code samples containing intentional issues. Each sample demonstrates a different category of problem: correctness errors, logic bugs, security vulnerabilities, dependency hallucinations, best practice violations, performance inefficiencies, and testability concerns. Work systematically through each check point, documenting your findings as you would in a real code review. This exercise builds critical thinking skills that transfer beyond AI assistance—you'll become better at reviewing any code, regardless of its source.
