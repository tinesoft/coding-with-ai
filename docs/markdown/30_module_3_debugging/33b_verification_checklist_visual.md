# AI Code Verification Checklist

![h-900 center](./assets/images/module-3/verification-checklist.svg)

Notes:
This comprehensive checklist provides a systematic framework for evaluating any AI-generated code. The seven verification points radiate from the central code artifact, each representing a critical quality dimension. Start at the top with correctness—does the code produce expected outputs for all inputs? Move clockwise through logic (edge cases and boundary conditions), security (vulnerabilities and input validation), dependencies (hallucinations and API verification), best practices (naming and structure), performance (algorithmic efficiency), and testability (mockability and isolation). The workflow at the bottom shows the complete verification cycle: read to understand intent, test with normal inputs, probe edge cases, inspect dependencies, apply the full seven-point review, refine based on findings, and validate that fixes don't introduce new issues. This systematic approach catches issues that manual inspection alone might miss.
