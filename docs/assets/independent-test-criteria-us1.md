10. **Warp AI** → CLI Agent

### Component 2: Tool Selection Scenarios (Secondary)
**Format**: Best-fit tool category recommendation  
**Time Limit**: Additional 3 minutes  
**Success Criteria**: 3/4 scenarios correctly matched

#### Sample Scenarios
1. **Scenario**: "Developer who exclusively works in terminal, needs AI help with Git commands"  
   **Answer**: CLI Agent
   
2. **Scenario**: "Team wants to try AI coding without changing their VS Code setup"  
   **Answer**: IDE Extension
   
3. **Scenario**: "Starting new project, wants maximum AI integration from day one"  
   **Answer**: Standalone IDE
   
4. **Scenario**: "Quick prototype for client demo, needs instant collaboration"  
   **Answer**: Online Tool

## Success Thresholds

### Individual Success (US1 Complete)
- **Primary**: 8/10 tools categorized correctly within 5 minutes

- **Minimum Viable**: 80% of learners achieve individual success
- **MVP Validation**: Cohort success confirms US1 delivers standalone value

## Test Environment

### Required Setup
- **Assessment Platform**: Simple web form or paper-based test
- **Timer**: Visible countdown for time pressure simulation
- **No External Resources**: Closed-book test using only US1 content

### Materials Provided
- Tool categorization reference sheet (optional)
- Category definitions reminder
- Clear instructions and examples

## Value Validation

### Immediate Value Delivered
Upon US1 completion, learners can:
- **Categorize AI Tools**: Understand the four main categories
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Choose appropriate tool types for scenarios
- **Evaluate Options**: Use systematic criteria for tool selection
- **Avoid Common Mistakes**: Understand category distinctions

### Professional Application
Learners can immediately apply this knowledge to:
- Research and evaluate AI coding tools for their team
- Make informed purchasing and adoption decisions
- Understand trade-offs between different tool approaches
- Guide tool selection discussions with colleagues

## Independent Test Administration

### Pre-Test Setup
1. **Content Delivery**: Complete US1 slides and exercises
2. **Knowledge Check**: Brief review of four categories
3. **Test Instructions**: Clear explanation of format and time limits

### During Test
1. **Timing**: Strict enforcement of time limits
2. **Independence**: No collaboration or external resources
3. **Clarity**: Available for instruction questions only

### Post-Test Validation
1. **Immediate Scoring**: Automated or rapid manual scoring
2. **Threshold Check**: Confirm individual and cohort success rates
3. **Value Confirmation**: Debrief on practical applications

## Failure Remediation

### Individual Failure (< 8/10 correct)
1. **Gap Analysis**: Identify specific category confusion patterns
2. **Targeted Review**: Re-examine problematic categories with examples
3. **Practice Test**: Additional categorization exercises
4. **Retest**: Second independent test opportunity

### Cohort Failure (< 80% success rate)
1. **Content Review**: Examine US1 slide effectiveness
2. **Delivery Adjustment**: Modify presentation or exercises
3. **Extended Practice**: Additional hands-on categorization activities
4. **Cohort Retest**: Group reassessment after remediation

## MVP Decision Point

### Proceed to US2 Criteria
- **Individual Success**: Learner achieves independent test thresholds
- **Confidence Check**: Learner reports confidence in tool selection
- **Application Ready**: Can discuss tool trade-offs and selection criteria

### MVP Validation Criteria
- **Cohort Success**: 80%+ learners pass independent test
- **Value Confirmation**: Learners report practical tool selection capability
- **Standalone Viability**: US1 alone provides actionable knowledge

## Success Documentation
